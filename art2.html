        A circular economy approach to e-waste management aims to keep materials in use for as long as possible, reducing waste and minimizing the need for new resource extraction. This can be achieved through various strategies:

<br>
Reusing and Refurbishing; Instead of discarding electronic devices prematurely, they can be refurbished and reused, either by the original owner or by reselling them to others. This extends the lifespan of the devices and reduces the amount of e-waste generated.
Recycling and Material Recovery: When devices can no longer be reused or refurbished, their components and materials can be recycled and recovered. This involves breaking down the devices and extracting valuable materials like metals, plastics, and glass for use in new products.
Design for Recyclability: Manufacturers can design electronic products with recyclability in mind, using materials and components that are easier to disassemble and recycle at the end of the product's life cycle.
<br>'E-waste mining is the term for the process of extracting valuable metals from e-waste.

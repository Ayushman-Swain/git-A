        Instead of discarding electronic devices prematurely, refurbishing and reusing them can significantly extend their lifespan.

<br><u>Refurbishing Process:</u> Refurbishing involves inspecting, repairing, and updating used electronic devices to restore them to a like-new condition. This may involve replacing worn-out components, updating software, and cleaning the devices.
<br><u>Promoting Reuse:</u> Refurbished devices can be resold or donated to individuals, organizations, or communities with limited resources, providing affordable access to technology and reducing the demand for new devices.
<br><u>Environmental Benefits:</u> By extending the lifespan of electronic devices, we can reduce the amount of e-waste generated and the associated environmental impacts of production, transportation, and disposal.
